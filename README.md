# Password Generator 🔐🔑

## Introduction ✨

 I built this cool little **Password Generator** web app! 😎 My goal was to create something super simple but powerful that lets anyone whip up a secure, custom password in a flash. No more weak passwords, my friend! This app lets you control everything – the length, whether you want small letters, capitals, numbers, or even those funky symbols. It was a fun project to bring to life, and I hope it helps keep your online life a bit safer! 😊
